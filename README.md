# taco_party

A hypnotic cascade of images. Good for all occasions.

This began as a quick and dirty contribution to a taco-themed birthday party (hence the name). It's grown a bit since then.

## Building

Astute observers may notice that many of the files in lib/ import a nonexistent `package:taco_party/everything.g.dart` that also is not generated by any `webdev` or `build_runner` commands. I tried doing it through the build system and it sucked and didn't work (apparently Angular wants to know everything that's being imported __before__ it starts), so the file is instead generated by running

```
pub run tools/generate_exports.dart
```

from the root directory.
